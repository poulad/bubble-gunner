# Bubble Gunner

_A CreateJS game_

Join the journey of bubble gunner to save lavaland animals. Shoot bubbles and catch animals but be careful! Pieces of lava are also falling down. 

## Getting Started

```bash
# restore packages and build the project
npm install

# run a server on port 5005 (by default)
npm start
```

and navigate to [localhost:5005](http://localhost:5005/).

For manually building the project afterwards:

```bash
npm run build
```

> @types type definitions will not be restored on old versions of node.

For development time, use [http://localhost:5005/index-dev.html](http://localhost:5005/index-dev.html) as it does not load the minified version of js files.

## Generating Audio Sprites
